Subject: [LaTeX/Metafont] Feynman diagrams: FeynMF v1.08 released

This announces version 1.08 of feynmf, a combined LaTeX and Metafont
(or Metapost) package for easy drawing of professional quality Feynman
(and maybe other) diagrams.

Version 1.08 is mainly a bug fix release and offers a driver script as
the only new feature.  The driver script is still experimental and I
will be grateful for portability suggestions (it has been developed with
teTeX under Linux).

This software will show up through the magic of mirroring at the CTAN
host near you.

Enjoy,
-Thorsten

NEWS for Version 1.08

    *  Improved very short gluon and photon propagators by relaxing
    overly aggressive rounding.

    *  New (still experimental) `feynmf' script automating the
    invocation of Metafont (requires perl(1)).
